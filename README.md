<h1>Vulnerability Assessment Report</h1>
<h3>5th August 2023</h3>

<h2>Project Description</h2>
A small project on Vulnerability assessment for a small business. The goal of this project is to evaluate the risks of a vulnerable information system and outline a remediation plan.
A vulnerability assessment is the internal review process of an organizationâ€™s security systems.

<h2>Scenario</h2>

<h2>System Description</h2>
<h3>The server </h3>
The server hardware consists of a powerful CPU processor and 128GB of memory. It runs on the latest version of Linux operating system and hosts a MySQL database management system. It is configured with a stable network connection using IPv4 addresses and interacts with other servers on the network. Security measures include SSL/TLS encrypted connections.
<h2>Scope</h2>
The scope of this vulnerability assessment relates to the current access controls of the system. The assessment will cover a period of three months, from June 20XX to August 20XX. NIST SP 800-30 Rev. 1 is used to guide the risk analysis of the information system.
<h2>Purpose</h2>
The remote database server is responsible for storing and managing large volumes of data. It is used to store customer information, campaign data, and analytic reports that need to be later analyzed to monitor the performance of the marketing efforts. It is very important to keep the system secure because is one of the core components of marketing operations.

<h2>Approach</h2>
The business's methods for data management and storage were taken into account while calculating risks. The likelihood of a security incident given the open access permissions of the information system was used to determine potential threat sources and occurrences. The severity of prospective incidents and their effect on ongoing operating requirements were compared.
<h2>Remediation Strategy</h2>
To ensure that only authorized users access the database server, authentication, authorization, and auditing methods must be put in place. To do this, employ multi-factor authentication, role-based access controls, and strong passwords to restrict user privileges. data in transit encryption using TLS rather than SSL. IP allow-listing to corporate premises helps stop unauthorized internet users from accessing the database.
